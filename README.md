# RPG_CharacSheet

RPG_CharacSheet is a UI made to handle more easily the character sheets of a Role Playing Game with specific rules that a friend created. Current stable version is made with Tkinter, but due to some performance issues, it is going to be totally reworked with Qt for Python (see Qt_Version branch).
